Problem 2: File Recursion
=========================
No additional data structures needed. Decided to use recursion to navigate the tree-like
dataset, used a helper function before calling the recursive method to check for certain edge cases,
such as wrong pathname, or no files with specified suffix found.


Space Complexity:
    O(n) where n is the total number of files with the specified suffix, which determines
            the size of the only created list.

Time Complexity:
    O(n) where n is the size of the largest list being returned from the recursive calls
        and then being iterated on via the extend method.
